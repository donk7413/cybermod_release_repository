"editor_main":"Welcome to CyberMod Editor :\\n\\n\\nHere you can use CyberMod to create your own contents like quest, npc, dialog...\\n\\n\\nFirst, some basics : \\n\\n\\nAlmost every element that you will see work with CyberMod's script system.\\n\\nAn script have some basics properties like an tag (unique identifier), an name.\\n\\nIt also have an trigger element who have severals properties.\\n\\nAn trigger is an script object who will, as his name said, trigger an event. \\n\\nBasically, when trigger's condition is fullfilled, CyberMod Script System Engine (SSE) will know that this event can run.\\n\\nUsually, an trigger have : \\n- an name\\n- some conditionals properties\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample : \\n\\n{\\n'name':'3Dposition',\\n'x': 500,\\n'y': 500,\\n'z': 500,\\n'range':50\\n}\\n\\n\\nIn this example, the trigger 3Dposition will check that player's position is in an range of 50 from X :500, Y:500, Z:500.\\nIf yes, trigger check engine will return true.\\nif Not, trigger check engine will return false.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow an element can have several trigger conditions. We wrap it into an property 'requirement'.\\n\\nAn requirement is an order of how the triggers need to be fullfilled.\\n\\nfor example\\n\\nlet's say we have an quest who have 3 triggers :\\n\\n'trigger':\\n\\n'trigger01' : {\\n'name':'3Dposition',\\n'x': 500,\\n'y': 500,\\n'z': 500,\\n'range':50\\n},\\n'trigger02' :{\\n'name':'in_car',\\n'x': 500,\\n'y': 500,\\n'z': 500,\\n'range':50\\n},\\n'trigger03' :{\\n'name':'time',\\n'min': 1800,\\n'max': 2300\\n}\\n\\n\\ntrigger01 will be fullfilled when player is in range of 50 for the position XYZ 500,500,500\\n\\ntrigger02 will be fullfilled when player is in car\\n\\ntrigger03 will be fullfilled when game's time is between 18:00 (6pm) and 23:00 (11pm)\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's say we want that our quest run when : \\n\\ntrigger01 is fullfilled\\n\\nOR\\n\\ntrigger02 AND trigger03 is fullfilled\\n\\n\\nTheses conditions are what we call an requirement.\\n\\nIn json, it's formated like :\\n\\n'requirement':\\n[\\n  ['trigger01'],\\n  ['trigger02','trigger03']\\n  \\n\\n]\\n\\n\\nYou can see it have 2 'groups' : \\none contains trigger01\\nseconds contains trigger02 AND trigger03\\n\\n\\nwe can translate it by :\\nrun my quest when group 1 is fullfilled (trigger01) OR group2 is fullfilled (trigger02 AND trigger03).\\n\\nEach group is an OR\\neach element in an group is an AND\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, last element that our object have is action.\\n\\nWho is, by is name, an list of actions that the script will run in order when requirements are fullfilled.\\n\\nlet's take an example : \\n\\n'actions':\\n[\\n\\n   {\\n'name':'notify',\\n'value':'Hello from CyberMod's Teams :) '\\n},\\n{\\n'name':'wait_second',\\n'value':5\\n},\\n{\\n'name':'notify',\\n'value':'Judy is love, Judy is life '\\n}\\n\\n]\\n\\nIn this example : \\nAn notification message will show with text : Hello from CyberMod's Teams :)\\n\\nthen the script will wait 5 real seconds\\n\\nthen an notification message will show with text : Judy is love, Judy is life\\n\\n\\nAs you can see, actions have an very similar syntax like trigger. it have an name and some parameters that depend of the nature of the action.\\n\\n\\nNow let's describe every elements of the editor :\\n\\n\\n\\nQuest : you can make an custom quest with one or several objectives, it can be chained or parallels objectives. \\nDialog : You can make an custom dialog with several choice that will launch actions.\\nPhoneDialog : You can make an custom phone dialog with several choice that will launch actions, it will show in game's hub menu, messages tabs.\\nInteract : You can make an custom interact with several choice that will launch actions.\\nEvent : You can make an event that will launch in world with several choice that will launch actions.\\nFixer : You can make an fixer who can trigger some quests.\\nFaction : You can make an Gang with several options.\\nRadio : You can make an Custom Radio that will play custom music.\\nLang : you can make your own lang file for translate datapack/ mod \\nItems : If you are in an custom place, you can make housing\\nTheme : You can change CET style for the mod.\\nInterface : You can make your own interface (an native popup that will show button and text)\\nHelp : You can make an custom shard that is tagged as Help in menu\\nPlace : you can define an location as Custom Place and setup several event in it (like housing or own this place)\\nFunction : an reusuable object that contains an list of actions.\\nNode : an Node is an XYZ Location that have an tag and several properties and can be bounded to an Circuit and an Path\\nCircuit : it's an order of Node\\nPath: it's an path that can be played (for vehicule like metro for example)\\nCustom NPC : you can setup an NPC who will spawn when you reach his location and range.\\nShard : you can setup an custom shard that you can acces throught shard menu\\nDatapack Builder: Here is the final step to make all of previous object that you did into an datapack :)\\n"
